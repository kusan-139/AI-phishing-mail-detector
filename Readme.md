# AI Phishing Email Detector üé£

This is a powerful web-based Phishing Email Detector built with Flask and Python. The application uses a hybrid approach to analyze emails, combining heuristic rule-based scoring, live API lookups (VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing), and a machine learning model to provide a comprehensive threat assessment.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Manual Analysis:** Paste email headers, subject, and body for an instant phishing score.
  * **Gmail Inbox Scan:** Securely log in with Google OAuth to scan your 5 most recent unread emails.
  * **Attachment Malware Scan:** Upload files to check them against the VirusTotal database for known malware.
  * **Hybrid Scoring System:**
      * **Heuristic Rules:** Checks for common phishing tactics like sender impersonation, urgency keywords, suspicious links, and generic greetings.
      * **Live API Checks:** Scans URLs and attachments in real-time using Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal.
      * **AI-Powered Detection:** A machine learning model (Logistic Regression) analyzes email text patterns to identify suspicious content.
  * **Feedback & Retraining:** An admin panel allows for viewing user feedback and retraining the AI model on the fly to improve its accuracy.
  * **Secure & Scalable:** Uses MongoDB for database storage and environment variables for secure key management.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8 or higher
  * A MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB server)
  * A Google Cloud Platform account
  * A VirusTotal API Key

### 2\. Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```

    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>

    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```

4.  **Set up Google OAuth Credentials**

      * Create a new project.
      * Go to **APIs & Services \> Credentials**.
      * Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** for a **Web application**.
      * Add `http://127.0.0.1:5000/oauth2callback` to the **Authorized redirect URIs**.
      * Click **DOWNLOAD JSON** and save the file in your project's root directory as `client_secret.json`.

5.  **Create the `.env` File**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add the following, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys and secrets:

    ```env
    # Flask Configuration
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY='<a-long-random-string-for-sessions>'

    # API Keys
    VT_API_KEY='<your-virustotal-api-key>'
    GOOGLE_API_KEY='<your-google-cloud-api-key-for-safe-browsing>'

    # Database
    MONGO_URI='<your-mongodb-connection-string>'

    # Admin Panel
    RETRAIN_SECRET_KEY='<a-secret-password-for-the-admin-panel>'
    ```

### 3\. Running the Application

1.  **Run the Flask App**
    With your virtual environment activated, run the main application file:

    ```
    flask run
    ```
    Alternatively:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```
2.  **Access the Web Interface**
